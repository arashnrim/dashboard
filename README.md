<h1 align="center">Dashboard</h1>

## Introduction
Welcome to the Dashboard project! This project is created for the 2021 Sec 4 Computing+ Coursework. The main intention of the Coursework was to design a Python-executable script that fulfils the group's Design Goal for a solution to impact the community positively.

### About the project
The Design Goal of this project is:
> Enabling easier use of a computer through an accessible, intuitive interface.

With this dashboard-like interface, our main goal is to establish an easy-to-use command-line interface for users who are not familiar with using computers. Having essential features in one place, this program should make it much easier to use a computer.

## Installing

### This program requires the following to be installed:
- Python (tested only â‰¥ 3.6.8)
- Terminal (pre-installed on macOS)

### Running the Program
Due to some limitations on IDLE, the program cannot be run on it. Instead, use the Terminal:

1.  At the location of the Python installation (usually at `/Applications/Python <version>/`), open and execute the "Install Certificates.command" file.
2. To use the feature on the radio, install the Chrome drivers at `/usr/local/bin/`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd /path/to/dashboard` (where `/path/to/dashboard` is replaced with the path to the folder)/
4. Install required modules: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
