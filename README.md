## Introduction
Welcome to the Dashboard project! This project is created for the 2021 Sec 4 Computing+ Coursework. The main intention of the Coursework was to design a Python-executable script that fulfils the group's Design Goal for a solution to impact the community positively.

### About the project
The Design Goal of this project is:
> Enabling easier use of a computer through an accessible, intuitive interface.

With this dashboard-like interface, our main goal is to establish an easy-to-use command-line interface for users who are not familiar with using computers. Having essential features in one place, this program should make it much easier to use a computer.
