Welcome to the dashboard project! This README aims to assist you in installing and running the program.

=== Prerequisites ===
This program requires the following to be installed:
- Python (tested only â‰¥ 3.6.8)
- Terminal (pre-installed on macOS)

=== Running the Program ===
Due to some limitations on IDLE, the program cannot be run on it. Instead, use the Terminal:
1. Navigate to the project directory: cd /path/to/dashboard (where /path/to/dashboard is replaced with the path to the folder)/
2. Install required modules: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
