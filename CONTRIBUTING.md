This Contributing file mostly applies to the project members; it serves as a sort of style guide to ensure code and language standardisation.

## Contributing to the source code
Before contributing to the source code, ensure that you have read through this document. While the guidelines below are not compulsory, it is heavily recommended to ensure that standardisation is constant throughout the source code, commit messages, and more.

In general, try to obey the following guidelines:
1. Keep titles to less than 50 characters.
2. Use a [word counter tool](https://wordcounter.net) and wrap each line (that is not the title) to 72 characters.
3. Use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) to provide the context of the commit.

For more details on how to style your commit message, check out this [helpful guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## Issues and pull requests
When noticing an issue or error in the source code, please create an Issue at the earliest convenience to ensure that we can fix it. Issues are also appropriate for discussing certain matters; at any point of discussion, feel free to use either the current chat group or an Issue to discuss them.

When working on individual features, **always create a branch for each one** to prevent merge conflicts. For every branch, obey the styling `branch-name`, where every space would otherwise be replaced by a hyphen (-). As much as possible, create a pull request only if one or more of these conditions are met:
- The feature has been completed and is ready to be merged with the main branch.
- There is a critical fix that patches an issue with an existing issue.

When creating pull requests, it is recommended for you to add other project members as reviewers to ensure that everyone has a look at the project. Once satisfied, close the pull request by **creating a merge commit** (not squashing or rebasing).

## Projects
The Projects tab is used as a task organisation tool. There, progress on features should be added and separated across the different columns (To do, In progress, Done).

If there is a pull request that is linked with a card, link the card in the request.
